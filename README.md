# Mechanical Engineering

This is an open-research conducted on Strength of Material and Design analysis, which are core study in Mechnical engineering. All material used during research are free of cost and open-source softwares, such as Jupyter Notebook, pandas, Python in-built libraries and Previous publish journals (most of them are professional industrial or univeristy websites)
